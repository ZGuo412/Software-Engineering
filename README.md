# Software-Engineering
Software Engineering Tool course at Purdue University

I implemented all projects with python. For the Lab and Prelab 1-3, I learnt how to use python. Then I implemented different projects with different tools.

Lab 12 is a project about image morphing. First I created a GUI for user to use. User is able to choose two images to morph and change the alpha value between 0 to 1. User can also select, delete and reselect the point-pair on both image. From the points I derived different affine transformation matrics for different sections of the image. Then I apply the obtained transformations between the images, blend two images to have a visually appealing result.

Example Images are in Lab12 folder.
